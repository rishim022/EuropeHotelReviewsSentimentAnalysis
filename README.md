European Hotels EDA,Visualization and Sentiment Analysis

Abstract

Using Naive Bayes Classifier for sentiment analysis on a dataset with 515K reviews on luxury European hotels, I have obtained a training accuracy of 93.5 percent, and a testing accuracy of 92.5 percent when predicting positive and negative reviews. The most informative words indicating a review to be positive or negative are also found, and positive reviews reflect more on hotel staff and location, while highly negative reviews tend to focus on facilities.
This project is based on my Final Project for Python for Data Science on edx, using sentiment analysis to analyze 515K European Hotel Reviews.

Motivation

During the past few years, us consumers rely increasingly heavily on online ratings and reviews when making decisions, especially when travelling to a new destination.
In this project, I am interested in looking for words that are strong indicators of positive or negative reviews through natural language processing and sentiment analysis. This could provide valuable insight to hotel management as well as similar websites collecting ratings to improve their performance and better target certain customers. It can also help fellow travellers understand which words are the most effective when leaving a review for their next stay.

Dataset

My dataset is the "515K Hotel Reviews Data in Europe" dataset on Kaggle (https:// www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe). The dataset is a .csv file of size 48MB, containing most text. The positive and negative reviews are already in columns. The reviews are all in English, collected from Booking.com from 2015 to 2017.

The dataset contains 515738 reviews for 1493 luxury hotels in Europe.
